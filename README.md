👋 Hi, Thanks for stopping by my Github page. I’m @emma1119.
I’m interested in applying Machine Learning and advance analytics to solve real-life problems using data. I will update my repos to share interesting projects which I have done or useful learnings materials.
🌱 I’m currently learning NLP, AI, ML using Python 📘, Microsoft Azure Cloud, and Latte Art ☕
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and connect with people with similar goals and passion for Data Science
📫 Feel free to connect with me through LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-hongfan-liu/
